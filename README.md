# AdventOfCode-2025

A bit late to the party! Completely forgot about it this year 😅. Been busy with other projects, but as they say, better late... no... a programmer is never late, he/she arrives precisely when he/she means to 🧙‍♂️. 

Since I didn't have time to prepare and think this through, I'm doing it in *Typescript*/*SvelteKit* this year. Might not be the best option, but it will be good exercise to maybe look into more TS data structures and constructs.

So yeah, nothing special this year, I'm actually delighted it's only 12 days/tasks from this year on. I will probably not be doing them every day, but there will be plenty of time during Christmas time.

So, here we go...
